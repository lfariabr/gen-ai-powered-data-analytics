1. What is the main purpose of conducting EDA before predictive modeling?
*a. To identify patterns, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset.*
b. To immediately build and apply a predictive model.
c. To replace missing values with AI-generated data before analyzing trends.
d. To adjust all data points so that they follow expected trends.

*b. Use statistical imputation methods (e.g., mean, median, regression-based) and validate them with domain knowledge.*
c. Assume missing values mean the customer has zero income or credit history.
d. Ignore missing values since AI can work around them.

3. What is one benefit of using synthetic data in financial modeling?
*a. It allows analysts to expand datasets while maintaining privacy.*
b. It automatically improves the accuracy of all predictive models.
