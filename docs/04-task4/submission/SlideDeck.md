# AI-Powered Collections Strategy
Leveraging agentic AI for fair, effective debt management at Geldium

---

## Slide 1: Title
- AI-Powered Collections Strategy
- Geldium | Tata iQ Analytics Team
- Date

*Speaker notes: Set vision—scale collections responsibly with AI plus guardrails.*

---

## Slide 2: How the System Works (4-Stage Loop)
- Inputs: utilization, missed payments, DTI, tenure, credit score
- Decision: logistic model + rules → risk tier (Low/Med/High)
- Actions: cadence/channel by tier (email/SMS/agent + offers)
- Learning: weekly outcomes; quarterly retrains; A/B winners auto-promoted

*Speaker notes: Stress the closed loop—data → decision → action → learning.*

---

## Slide 3: Agentic Scope (AI vs Human)
- AI: reminders, timing optimization, self-service routing, A/B tests, logging
- Human: hardship approvals, limit changes, disputes, edge-case overrides, regulatory sign-off
- Principle: automate high-volume/low-stakes; humans on high-impact or discretionary calls

*Speaker notes: Show clear accountability boundaries.*

---

## Slide 4: Responsible AI Guardrails
- Fairness: weekly demographic checks; flag >10% disparate impact; remove proxies
- Explainability: plain-language reasons; SHAP for compliance reviews
- Compliance: ECOA/GDPR/FCA/FCRA alignment; audit trail (data, model, threshold, action, override)
- Oversight: uncertainty flags to human queue; customer appeal path

*Speaker notes: Governance is built-in, not bolted on.*

---

## Slide 5: Expected Impact (Year 1 Targets)
- Delinquency: 16% → ≤14% (−12%)
- Cost per contact: $8 → ≤$5 (−37%)
- Right-party contact: 55% → ≥70% (+15pp)
- Model recall: 70% → ≥80% (+10pp)
- Financial impact: ~$5.4M annual benefit; better customer experience via tailored outreach

*Speaker notes: Link metrics to both business value and fairness.*

---

## Slide 6: Rollout Plan (Pilot-First)
- Pilot Weeks 1–6: high-risk only (~2K); success: ≥8% delinquency reduction, <3% opt-outs
- Evaluate Weeks 7–8: analyze, refine thresholds/messaging, go/no-go
- Scale Months 3–6: add medium-risk; enable portal; uptime >99.5%

*Speaker notes: Milestones and exit criteria keep risk low.*

---

## Slide 7: Ask & Next Steps
- Approve $250K pilot budget (6 weeks)
- Align IT, Compliance, Collections, Risk on data access and escalation playbooks
- Kick off Week 1; steering review at Week 8

*Speaker notes: End with the decision and immediate actions to start.*
