How the System Works

Inputs: What customer data is collected (e.g., demographics, repayment history, credit utilization)?
Decision Logic: How are actions determined? Does the system use business rules, model predictions, or both?
Actions: What outreach or interventionsa would be triggered (e.g., payment reminders, hardship offers)?
Learning: How will the system track outcomes and improve over time?

### PTT Template Notes
- Generate a simple outline for an AI collections system workflow, including inputs, decision logic, action triggers, and learning loop.
- List 3–5 key customer attributes that would be most predictive for collections decision-making, and explain why each one matters.
- Suggest examples of business rules and AI-driven actions the system could use at different risk levels (e.g., low, medium, high risk).
- Create a rough sketch or step-by-step description of how customer data flows through the system from intake to action.

## Slide 3
### Contents
Role of Agentic AI

Explain which parts of the system will operate autonomously and which require human oversight. Consider:
Fully automated decisions (e.g., sending a reminder email)
Human-reviewed actions (e.g., offering personalized hardship plans)

### PTT Template Notes
- Explain how agentic AI could automate financial collections while keeping humans in critical decision points.
- List 3–5 examples of collection actions, and classify each as best suited for full automation or requiring human oversight, with a brief reason why.

## Slide 4

Responsible AI Guardrails

List and describe key safeguards you would build into the system to ensure it operates fairly and responsibly, such as:
Fairness checks to prevent biased outcomes
Explainability requirements for transparency
Regulatory compliance with standards like ECOA, GDPR, or local laws
Human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions

### PTT Template Notes
- List key fairness, transparency, and compliance practices to build into an AI-powered credit collections system.
- Suggest specific ways to monitor and audit the system over time to ensure it stays fair, compliant, and effective.

## Slide 5

Expected Business Impact

Summarize in 1-2 slides how your proposed system would benefit Geldium’s collections strategy, considering both business and customer outcomes:
Quantitative outcomes: Reduced delinquency, increased repayment rates, cost savings
Qualitative outcomes: Improved customer trust, enhanced fairness, increased scalability

### PTT Template Notes
- Suggest KPIs for an AI-powered collections strategy that balances business outcomes with customer fairness.
